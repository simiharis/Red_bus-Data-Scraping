Red bus Data scraping with selenium and dynamic filtering using streamlit
       Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.In this Project, we aim to scrape data from RedBus, a popular online bus ticket booking platform, to extract useful information such as bus routes, timings, prices, and seat availability.

Steps to Scrape RedBus Data Using Selenium
•	Set Up Selenium:
•	Install the Selenium package via pip install selenium.
•	Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) to interact with the browser.
•	Identify Data to Scrape:

•	The RedBus website provides useful information such as bus names, routes, bus types, departure and arrival times, seat availability, and ticket prices.
•	These data points are typically loaded dynamically using JavaScript, making Selenium an ideal choice.
•	Navigate the RedBus Website:

•	We can automate actions like opening the website, searching for buses between cities, and navigating through multiple pages of results.
•	Each result contains individual bus information that can be extracted.
•	Extract the Data:

•	After navigating the site, use Selenium to locate the HTML elements containing the desired information (e.g., bus name, price, etc.) and extract their text.
•	Handle Pagination:

•	If there are multiple pages of results, Selenium can be used to click through the pagination and scrape data from each page.
•	Example Workflow of Scraping RedBus Data Using Selenium
•	Below is an outline of the steps to extract bus details from the RedBus website using Selenium:

•	Initialize Selenium and Open the RedBus Website:

•	Set up a Selenium WebDriver to automate a browser (e.g., Chrome) and open the RedBus homepage.
•	Search for Buses:

•	Simulate entering a source and destination city and selecting a travel date.
•	Extract Bus Details
        With the help of Streamlit, an interactive application similar to RedBus is made designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and get details like departure times and prices.
